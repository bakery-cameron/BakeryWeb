			<p>Southby is just days away, and if you haven’t yet sifted through the hundreds of events on SXSW.com, Facebook, Eventbrite, Do512, and RSVPSTER, worry not. We did the work for you. Whether you have a badge or not, there is plenty of fun to had, people to meet, and ideas to be inspired by. Below are some of our top picks for South By Southwest Interactive. Give us a shout if you plan to be at any of these panels or parties.</p>

					Capital Factory
					<br>

			<h3>THURSDAY, MARCH 13TH</h3>

			<div class="sx-info">
				<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2015/events/event_IAP33111" target="_blank">
					<h3 class="thin">Neuroplasticity and Tech: Why Brands Have to Change</h3>
				</a>
				<p>
					11:00am - 12:00pm
					<br>
					<br>
					Hyatt Regency Austin
					<br>
					Hill Country ABCD 208 Barton Springs Rd

				<img class="wow fadeInUp" src="../../../images/blog/2015/mar-09-inline-02.png" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay=".1s"></img>
			</div>
			<p>With the major shifts of the web, social media and mobile, and the levels of messaging they've ushered in, the nature and pace of change heralded by the age of technology is unprecedented.</p>

			<p>Since every new experience changes our brains, we set out to explore the question: What is looking at our inbox and phone 100s of times a day doing to our heads and, importantly, what does this ‘hyperstimulation’ mean for attention spans, cognition and brand recall?</p>

			<p>We will get specific about the concept of ‘neuroplasticity’ and share our latest research on how technology is fundamentally altering the way we connect. Working with neuroscience experts, we explore the challenge to marketers in the digital age – whether technology represents a new way of communicating, or if it requires us to communicate in new ways.</p>

			<p>As technology continues to dominate our lives, we will discuss our evolving relationship with it – and the ways in which brands can ensure they play a positive role in this process.</p>

			<div class="sx-info">
				<a href="http://sxswalistpitch.splashthat.com/" target="_blank">

			<div class="sx-info">
				<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2015/events/event_IAP33005" target="_blank">
					<h3 class="thin">How Kids Changed the Way We Design for Adults</h3>
				</a>
				<p>
					5:00pm - 6:00pm
					<br>
					<br>
					JW Marriott - Salon D
					<br>
					110 E 2nd Street
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>Kids don’t have patience for user experience research. They don’t care what your marketing team wants, and they won’t make an effort to please your developers. They’re not loyal to your brand. And, of course, the youngest among them can’t even read.</p>

			<p>But rather than thinking that kids are clueless, we need to view them as a clue to designing better digital products and services for people of all ages. After all, don’t your users sound a lot like the description above? Adults are also impatient, uncooperative, unloyal, and can — but won’t — read information on a screen!</p>

			<p>By adapting your research and design processes to align with the preferences, cognitive abilities, social skills, and attention spans of kids — you’ll be better armed to create innovative, intuitive, and delightful products and services for adults. This session will show you how to evolve your methodologies and take advantage of an emerging set of digital design principles inspired by today’s youngest users.</p>

					JW Marriott - Salon 1
					<br>
					110 E 2nd Street
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>The c-word. Some women might cringe at the thought of it, yet others light up. They choose the latter when the word is C-level. But what does it take for women to break through the C-suite glass ceiling, especially in the tech industry’s notorious boy’s club. Silicon Valley is a cutthroat job market where unbelievable talent line the streets. We’re currently at a time when “leaning in” is encouraged, but is that really the right path to success? What are the real challenges – personal and professional – that women need to navigate in order to succeed?</p>

			<p>Moderated by Re/Code’s Kara Swisher, this panel will feature powerful women who’ve made it to the C-suite in Silicon Valley – Lyft’s CMO Kira Wampler, Pandora’s CSO Sara Clemens, and BlogHer’s CEO Lisa Stone. Together, they will share their approach towards problem solving, leadership, and interpersonal challenges. They will also share their own stories about how they got their start, how they’ve landed where they are now.</p>

			<p>As with so many projects, what initially appeared as a simple concept turned out to be the guise of something much more complex and intricate. Yet, even as the project revealed its hidden quirks and problems waiting to be solved, it needed to have a veil of simplicity, to have the effortless usability associated with today’s successful applications. Phocrastinate called for a minimal interface that would minimize user error and promote use through ease, and a back end invisible to/hidden from the world.</p>

			<div class="blog-image-container">
				<img class="wow fadeInUp" src="../../../images/blog/2014/aug-05-inline-01.gif" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay=".1s"></img>
			</div>

			<p>The idea was to create a photography-based application that allowed all users to view the same photo(s) at the same time, all over the world. At any given time, only three photos are active: the previous, current, and next photos. Users upload photos, which are added to a queue, the “reel,” and eventually those photos will advance to the front of the queue, making it visible on the front end of the application. Each photo gets three seconds of fame before leaving the spotlight. Uploaded images are curated on the back end, with monitors overviewing each addition to the reel to eliminate photos containing profanity or inappropriate content while approving those that are considered suitable for viewing.</p>

			<p>The user experience of Phocrastinate is fundamentally tied to its central concept, so that had to be taken into consideration while wireframing and designing the interface. The user’s focus needed to be on the photo reel at virtually all times, with as few distractions as possible. So, in keeping with the responsive nature required by the application, the photo reel itself was designed to take up as much screen real estate as possible, regardless of the device used to access the site. The other necessary elements of the site- logo, navigation, fullscreen button, and the top 10 archive- are present and accessible, but generally hidden or sized and positioned to be as unobtrusive as possible.</p>

			<p>Of course, despite the deceptive “simplicity” of the interface, we encountered the same phenomenon that occurred during the planning process; actually creating the application would prove to be much more arduous. Not to mention that in addition to the live user-side, the photos needed to be monitored and admins needed certain authority over users and images. A corresponding management system also had to be created. Clean, seemingly straightforward mockups are nice, but only get you so far. Beneath are layers of functionality to work out, transitions and animations to consider, timing, errors, messages, instructions and more, then finally testing it all. Just deciding on if, then how uploaded photos would be cropped and presented as thumbnails, previews, as well as maximized images, respectively, took days- more likely a week or two- of pouring over what would result in the most seamless use and viewing experience for users. It’s a lot for a small team to curate, but we were up to the challenge.</p>

			<div class="blog-image-container">
				<img class="wow fadeInUp" src="../../../images/blog/2014/aug-05-inline-02.png" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay=".1s"></img>
			</div>

			<p>Finally, after weeks of testing and refining following months of design and development, Phocrastinate was ready for its debut. The journey was taxing, as any project is, filled with ups and downs, victories and defeats, and plenty of critical thinking and decision-making. So for now, take a peek, upload some pictures, and start <a class="text-link-bakery-pink" href="http://www.phocrastinate.com/">Phocrastinating!</a></p>

		<section id="blog-main" class="grow-container block">
			<p>It's been a long three years since Bakery officially started up and there have been a lot of memorable moments during this journey — mostly good, some bad and some a little ugly.</p>

			<h3>THE GOOD: AUSTIN</h3>

			<p>Austin's growth as a city combined with the College system molding and generating talent for our industry locally makes recruiting easy. It is not hard to convince someone that they should stay here in Austin, or even move here. Our wonderful city offers a little bit of everything — great music, a vibrant social setting, and a highly creative environment — which decreases the risk of losing someone to another hub. The business and start-up boom that Austin achieved in the last decade has been phenomenal also. We are now attracting larger corporations and the market is starting to recognize Austin on a larger spectrum as a stellar talent pool.</p>

			<p>Basically, with a lot of elbow grease and tons of help from friends and family, Austin is a place where a business can grow; Bakery is evidence of that.</p>

			<h3>THE BAD: PRIORITIZING</h3>

			<p>Growth, as it turns out, isn’t the boozy trip you might see on an episode of Mad Men. We’ve had to learn to handle the fickle whims of the digital advertising market, which changes on an hourly basis quite frankly. If we do not keep up with the latest technology and new platforms that are constantly popping up then we can quickly become irrelevant. You may think this is a given, as did we, but try keeping up with what <a class="text-link-bakery-red" href="http://www.paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a> or <a class="text-link-bakery-red" href="http://trentwalton.com/">Trent Walton</a> have to say when you have 8 deliverables leaching the life out of your team as it is.</p>

			<p>This brings me to my next point, balancing the client work load when you’ve been successful. [This deserves an article of its own, and maybe I’ll free up some hours soon to write it.] We came into this whole thing prepared to work 16 hour days to get the company going, of course. However, how could we have predicted unending days almost from the start?</p>

			<p>Building credentials was a daily sink or swim situation for us and by the time we looked up and noticed people <i>wanted</i> to work with us, we started getting even busier. I’m sure I’ll tell you it was all a ton of fun in a few years, but man, it is no picnic!</p>

			<h3>THE UGLY: STATE & GOVERNMENT</h3>

			<p>The worst part of the last three years of running Bakery has to be all of the state and government filings and paperwork. For some reason, I always believed that these public institutions would make it easy for someone to open a business, especially in the middle of a recession. Well, that’s one assumption I threw into the burn pile long ago.</p>

			<p>We have spent a year trying to get certified as a Minority Owned Business, which should be easy if you’re a minority and you own a business. The way it works is you turn in the paperwork, it falls into oblivion with no particular urgency on the part of the government institution running the show, and months later, with no warning, you get a call and are told that you need to turn in more paperwork to get certified. There are also fees; So. Many. Fees.</p>

			<p>Well, at least it’s all really easy after you deal with the company’s launch. (See The Bad).</p>
